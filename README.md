# Memory Game
The Memory Game is a fun and interactive game that helps improve memory and cognitive skills. 
The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards based on the images or symbols shown on them. 
It’s a great way to test your memory, concentration, and recall speed.

## Features
Simple Gameplay: A grid of face-down cards is presented to the player. Players flip over two cards at a time to try and match them.

Matching Pairs: If the two flipped cards match, they remain face-up; otherwise, they are turned face-down again.

Score Tracking: Keep track of the number of moves it takes to match all the pairs, and aim to improve your performance each time you play.

Timer: The game can include a timer to challenge players to match all the pairs within a certain time limit.

Winning Condition: The game ends when all the card pairs are matched correctly.

## How to Play
